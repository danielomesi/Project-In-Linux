Hi, this is a linux project as part of an intro course to Linux in college, along with 2 other students.
We have implemented an api application which fetches data of aiports and aircrafts, manipulates it and displayes it to the user.

Note:
Make sure libzip library installed on the machine before execution.

Extract Instructions:
Extract the files here to a folder in Linux machine, the folder should contain:
CMakeLists.txt (file), Script.sh (bash script), Cpp files, Headers and Library (all folders that contain cpp/h files).

Compilation Instructions:
1. Navigate using the terminal to the folder "Ex02"
2. Run the following command in this order: "chmod u+x Script.sh", "cmake CMakeLists.txt", "make"

Notes:
In options 1-3, the data will be fetched from the local database if possible (to prevent multiple api requests).
If the user wants to get updated data, it is needed to choose the update option and then restart the program.
(A message is appeared to the users explaining this on options 1-3)
